Default Risk Identification and Mitigation
Problem Overview
The main issue faced by the company is the increasing risk of default among customers, which can negatively impact the financial health and stability of the business. Identifying customers who are at risk of default is crucial to prevent further losses, but this is not an easy task due to the various factors that influence a customer’s ability to repay.

Key Factors Influencing Default Risk:
Employment Status: Stability in employment often correlates with a customer’s ability to repay debts.

Income: Higher income may indicate a better repayment capacity, but there are exceptions where high-income customers still default.

Monthly Expenses: The ratio of income to expenses plays a critical role in a customer's ability to meet repayment obligations.

Credit History: A strong credit history may signal a lower likelihood of default.

External Economic Conditions: Broader economic conditions such as inflation and recession can affect a customer's ability to repay.

In addition, there are groups of customers with high income who still default, indicating that other factors, besides income, play a significant role in determining default risk.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a robust solution to identify customers at high risk of default and mitigate these risks through predictive modeling and effective business strategies. The solution will leverage historical data analysis, predictive models, and relevant business strategies to enhance the company's financial stability.

Key Features
Data Analysis: Historical data will be analyzed to uncover patterns related to defaults, including the identification of high-risk customer segments.

Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models will be built to predict the likelihood of default for individual customers, using features like income, employment status, credit history, and more.

Business Strategies: Recommendations will be provided for risk mitigation strategies such as stricter loan approvals for high-risk customers and personalized loan offers.

Approach
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Gather customer data, clean and preprocess it to ensure quality insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform detailed analysis to understand trends, correlations, and patterns.

Modeling: Use predictive models such as Random Forest or XGBoost to classify customers into high or low-risk categories.

Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

Business Recommendations: Provide actionable business insights based on the analysis and model results.
